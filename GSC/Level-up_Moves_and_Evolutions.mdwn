Starting at offset 0x427BD (Gold/Silver) or 0x425B1 (Crystal) is an array of 251 two‐byte pointers. Following a pointer will lead you to the evolutions and level‐up moves of each Pokémon. The pointers are in Pokédex order.

Once you find the data, you’ll see that the format is as follows:

    <Evolution>+ <0x00> <Attack>+ <0x00>

An evolution is defined like this:

    <Evolution Type> <Trigger> <Evolves To>

The trigger depends on the evolution type.

* Evolution Type 0x01: Trigger is the level at which the Pokémon evolves.

* Evolution Type 0x02: Trigger is the item number of the evolution stone.

* Evolution Type 0x03: Trigger is a held item used while trading, or 0xFF for non‐item trade.

* Evolution Type 0x04: The Pokémon evolves when happy. Trigger is:

 * 0x01: Any time of day.

 * 0x02: Morning or Day.

 * 0x03: Night.

* Evolution Type 0x05: The Pokémon evolves at a certain level, but only if it has certain stats. Trigger is two bytes, the first being the level and the second being:

 * 0x01: Attack > Defense

 * 0x02: Attack < Defense

 * 0x03: Attack = Defense

Attacks are easier. They are just:

    <Level> <Attack>
