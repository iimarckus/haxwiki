# Editing this wiki

[Register to edit here](http://diyhpl.us/piny-commands/newuser/) and [see other commands](http://diyhpl.us/piny-commands/). You can also clone this wiki with git and push changes back:

    git clone git://wiki.iimarck.us/haxwiki.git

Note to push changes you must push with your registered account:

    git push username@wiki.iimarck.us:/srv/git/haxwiki.git master

You can make this easier by updating the remotes:

    git remote add origin username@diyhpl.us:/srv/git/haxwiki.git master

Now "git push" should work without debilitating complaint.
